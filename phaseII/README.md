# (**DRAFT**) Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Members: Nicholas Shaddox, Zane Gabor, and Fabian Garcia**

# Methods

* data gathered from persona/scenario (cognitive walkthrough)
* informal feedback
* billboard design

We used Wireframeing, Cognitive Walkthroughs and Informal Feedback during this phase of research to better understand out user base.

## Wireframing

We used wireframing as a fast way to produce the interactie design of our application (strictly the mobile applications portion). Wireframing allowed us to design and redesign with a relatively low cost with respect to time and money.

## Cognitive Walkthrough
We used peer reviewed cognitive walkthroughs during this phase. We recieved two of them but one particularly stood out to us. It was very well written (as a walkthrough) and help us discover many issues with out wireframes and the overall design of the application.

This walk through was done with our [persona](https://github.com/UsabilityEngineering/team-builder/tree/main/personas) of **Chelsea Bell**.

Education: B.A in Education 

Chelsea recently bought a house and enjoys having company over. She has a cat and a dog and loves to go out on the weekends. When the weather allows, She enjoys going sailing with her friends and family. She uses a lot of group activities to promote sharing and team building. She would like a new way to group students.

Goals:
* Group compatible students together
* Make sure all students are in a group

> Chelsea doesn’t have an account and clicks register to sign up for the app. She knows she is making progress and did the right thing as the page loads the registration page.
>
> Chelsea fills out her information and hits register. She knows she is making progress as she reaches the homepage. She knows she is doing the right thing as she got access to the home page.
>
> Chelsea doesn’t know exactly what to do to accomplish her goal at the moment as there are no explanations but symbols for buttons on the screen. The plus symbol is fine, but what is the symbol for? Adding or creating what?
>
> Chelsea clicks the Plus Icon thinking it will add a team. She knows she is making progress as she sees the create a team page and thinks is making progress toward her goal.
>
> Chelsea fills out the information with the team name plus the number of students in her class as the team size. She knows she is making progress as she gets to the page that has her newly created team and thinks she is making progress toward her goal.
>
> Chelsea realizes that it is for an individual team and knows she wants a group of teams for her class.
>
> Chelsea Hits the back arrow. She knows she is making progress toward her goal as she goes back to the homepage. She thinks she is making progress toward her goal.
>
> Chelsea clicks on the second plus icon to see if it will help her and carefully looks at the screen this time. She knows she is making progress as she can see that she is making a group of teams. She is making progress toward her goal as she is on the create a group page.
>
> Chelsea enters the number of teams she needs based on her class size with the group name and creates the group. Chelsea knows she is making progress as she gets to a
page with her newly created group. She is making progress toward her goal.
>
> Chelsea sends her class the member invite key. She has no idea if she is making progress at this point. Has no idea what the member invite key does.
>
> Chelsea clicks on the hamburger icon in the group. She has no idea if she is making progress or not. The buttons beside delete the group are not clear or not clear what they do.
>
> Chelsea has no idea how to create teams in her group for her class. Buttons are not very clear. Chelsea knows for sure she is making no progress at the moment.
>
> Chelsea decides to make individual teams for her class, She clicks the plus icon for individual teams. She knows she is making progress as she sees the team creation
page. She has no idea if she is doing the correct actions to progress toward her goals or not now.
>
> Chelsea enters the team name and the number of students she wants in the group and hits creates the team. She knows she is making progress as she is now on the page of the newly created team. She has no idea if she is doing the correct actions to progress toward her goals or not now.
>
> Chelsea has no idea again what to do at this point and decides to click the hamburger button. She has no idea if she is making progress or not as it isn’t clear how to add students to any team she makes. She has no idea if she is doing the correct actions to progress toward her goals or not now.
>
> Chelsea cannot figure out how to progress in the teambuilder app and can’t complete her goals and scenario.


## Findings
Going from the sketches to the wireframes was a drastic change, not just from the visual asthetic (although similar), but also to the workflow. It was much easier to colaborate with the team using Adobe XD than it was to coordinate any sketches. It was made easier because we could see any changes that were made in real time. 

The wireframes themselves helped us discover some of the short coming that our sketches could not provide insight on.
