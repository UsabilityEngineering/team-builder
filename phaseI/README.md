# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs


As we move forward into the future there is a rising need for an ease of use program ready built to assign teams at the push of a button. **Team Builder** will strive to be the complete package, including everything necessary to build a **well balanced team** under user set parameters with full chat functionality in order to have **every tool in one place**.

Our **Competitive Analysis** lead to a few important observations:
 - Our *closest competitor* has a UI that is out of date and **requires a subscription fee**
 - Chat programs **donâ€™t have an automated team building function**
 - Survey tools are great for data collection, but they **do not have robust chat functionality**
 - There is **no available free program** that **combines all of the functions listed above** into one usable package

Our **Heuristic Evaluation** shed light on the **format we would like to emulate for ease of use**.
The needs of our **personas** lead the design our system to include:
 - **Two primary roles** for the users of Team Builder, **Organizers** and the **Organized**
 - The Organizer needs to be able to input **their own parameters** for team sorting.
 - The Organized will be able to adjust their **user profile** to specify **preferred roles and working styles**.

Our **sketches** gave us a view of:
 - The user interface made to **streamline relevant information** for the user
 - Actions for creating and giving **input on possible teams** will be up front in design so as to **reduce app travel** for any given task.
