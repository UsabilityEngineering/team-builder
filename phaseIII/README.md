# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

Prototype link:  adobeXD_prototypelink.link

# Introduction:
We are Team-Builder , our application has the goal of assembling teams in an efficient , and simple manner. One of the situations we are hoping to solve is collaboration between different classes. While also assembling the teams based on the user's team preferences. 

# Methods:
In total we had 5 participants, we informed them of our study and had them sign consent forms. Our group had two different protocols: a student, and a professor protocol. We had 4 students and 1 professor participate in our study. After we introduced ourselves and went over warm up questions. We handed them an iPad device loaded with our prototype. For the student protocol we had them complete 4 tasks. The first task was to join a specific project as a late entry. The second task was to introduce yourself via the chat menu to your group partners. The third task was to locate your group members. The Final task was to log out. For the professor protocol we had 1 participant who completed 4 tasks. The first task was to create the final project. The second task was to remove a specific student from a project. The third task was to dissolve a group and move the group members to new teams. The final task was to remove the collaborative entity. 

# Findings Section:
(**Student protocol:**)


(**Task 1:**)
Most students completed the tasks successfully, but not without problems. Although the tasks were completed successfully, some participants mentioned the need for "clarification" or " intuition" regarding the team / group. One participant was afraid of looking around due to fear of "breaking" said prototype. All participants successfully completed the task and took the expected path.

(**Task 2:**)
All participants completed the task successfully, and most found the chat feature to be in a realistic position. All participants followed the expected path.

(**Task 3:**)
All participants completed the task successfully, some expressed suggestions to make it more learnable. One participant mentioned that the drop down menu was redundant because it only had one selection. Another participant suggested a person icon, which would make it more learnable. 

(**Task 4:**)
All participants completed the task successfully, but expressed that the feature was unnecessary. All of the participants expressed that logout on a mobile device is not necessary. One mentioned that asking if they are sure they want to log out is redundant. Another participant mentioned that the location of the logout feature was not in a intuitive place. 


(**Professor protocol**)

(**Task 1:**)
Task was completed , and participant expressed that it could have been more intuitive by adding teams. The path taken was as expected.

(**Task 2:**)
Task was completed. Professor expressed that steps to delete students were confusing , but get the job done. 

(**Task 3:**)
Task was completed and the expected path was taken. No comments were made by participant.

(**Task 4:**)
Task was completed to a degree. Participant expressed a desire to keep the collaborative entity for records sake. Potential feature inbound.
