# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

### Executive Summary

As we move forward into the future there is a rising need for an ease of use program ready built to assign teams at the push of a button. **Team Builder** will strive to be the complete package, including everything necessary to build a **well balanced team** under user set parameters with full chat functionality in order to have **every tool in one place**.

Our **Competitive Analysis** lead to a few important observations:
* Our closest **competitor** has a UI that is out of date and **requires a subscription fee**
* Chat programs **don’t have an automated team building** function
* Survey tools are great for data collection, but they **do not have robust chat functionality**
* There is **no available free program** that combines **all of the functionality** listed above into one usable package

Our **Heuristic Evaluation** shed light on the format we would like to emulate for ease of use.

The needs of our **personas** lead the design our system to include:
* Two **primary roles** for the users of Team Builder, **Organizers** and the **Organized**
* The Organizer needs to be able to **input their own parameters** for team sorting
* The Organized will be able to adjust their **user profile** to specify **preferred roles and working styles**

Our **sketches** gave us a view of:
* The user interface made to **streamline relevant information** for the user
* Actions for creating and giving **input on possible teams** will be up front in design so as to **reduce app travel** for any given task

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

### Executive Summary

We’ve officially made it past phases one and two in the development of Team Builder. In our efforts to make it an all in **one program for building and managing teams**, we have had several **learning experiences** that have guided the direction of progress on our way to a **usable product**.

We created our initial **wireframes** to:
* Achieve a **basic understanding of the layout** we are going to use in our application.
* **Identify** and map out the **key elements** of our application
* Gain an understanding of the process of putting together a wireframe to begin with.

Upon receiving our **Cognitive Walkthrough** we were presented with a number of problems regarding our wireframes, many of which existed because they were incomplete.
* **Recurring feedback** was that our application was **confusing to use** 
* Many elements presented a **poor mental model** for new users
* The application **did not provide feedback** to the user regarding the task they were currently completing
* Testers were unsure which buttons lead to which page

Moving forward we have refined our work around the given **feedback**.
* The wireframes are now **complete**
* Directions are now **learnable for new users**
* Creating a new group/team is **easier to follow**
* Group and team icons were revised for a **better mental model**
* Confirmation messages added for functions to **provide feedback** to user
