# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

### Executive Summary

As we move forward into the future there is a rising need for an ease of use program ready built to assign teams at the push of a button. **Team Builder** will strive to be the complete package, including everything necessary to build a **well balanced team** under user set parameters with full chat functionality in order to have **every tool in one place**.

Our **Competitive Analysis** lead to a few important observations:
* Our closest **competitor** has a UI that is out of date and **requires a subscription fee**
* Chat programs **donâ€™t have an automated team building** function
* Survey tools are great for data collection, but they **do not have robust chat functionality**
* There is **no available free program** that combines **all of the functionality** listed above into one usable package

Our **Heuristic Evaluation** shed light on the format we would like to emulate for ease of use.

The needs of our **personas** lead the design our system to include:
* Two **primary roles** for the users of Team Builder, **Organizers** and the **Organized**
* The Organizer needs to be able to **input their own parameters** for team sorting
* The Organized will be able to adjust their **user profile** to specify **preferred roles and working styles**

Our **sketches** gave us a view of:
* The user interface made to **streamline relevant information** for the user
* Actions for creating and giving **input on possible teams** will be up front in design so as to **reduce app travel** for any given task
