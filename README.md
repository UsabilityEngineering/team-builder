# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

### Executive Summary

As we move forward into the future there is a rising need for ease of use program ready built to assign teams at the push of a button. **Team Builder** will strive to be the complete package, including everything necessary to build a **well-balanced team** under user-set parameters with full chat functionality to have **every tool in one place**.

Our **Competitive Analysis** lead to a few important observations:
* Our closest **competitor** has a UI that is out of date and **requires a subscription fee**
* Chat programs **don’t have an automated team building** function
* Survey tools are great for data collection, but they **do not have robust chat functionality**
* There is **no available free program** that combines **all of the functionality** listed above into one usable package

Our **Heuristic Evaluation** shed light on the format we would like to emulate for ease of use.

The needs of our **personas** lead the design of our system to include:
* Two **primary roles** for the users of Team Builder, **Organizers** and the **Organized**
* The Organizer needs to be able to **input their own parameters** for team sorting
* The Organized will be able to adjust their **user profile** to specify **preferred roles and working styles**

Our **sketches** gave us a view of:
* The user interface made to **streamline relevant information** for the user
* Actions for creating and giving **input on possible teams** will be upfront in design so as to **reduce app travel** for any given task

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

### Executive Summary

**REWRITE**
We’ve officially made it past Phase I and II in the development of Team Builder. In our efforts to make it an all in **one program for building and managing teams**, we have had several **learning experiences** that have guided the direction of progress on our way to a **usable product**.

We created our initial **wireframes** to:
* Achieve a **basic understanding of the layout** we are going to use in our application.
* **Identify** and map out the **key elements** of our application
* Gain an understanding of the process of putting together a wireframe, to begin with.

Upon receiving our **Cognitive Walkthrough** we were presented with several problems regarding our wireframes, many of which existed because they were incomplete.
* **Recurring feedback** was that our application was **confusing to use** 
* Many elements presented a **poor mental model** for new users
* The application **did not provide feedback** to the user regarding the task they were currently completing
* Testers were unsure which buttons lead to which page

Moving forward we have refined our work around the given **feedback**.
* The wireframes are now **complete**
* Directions are now **learnable for new users**
* Creating a new group/team is **easier to follow**
* Group and team icons were revised for a **better mental model**
* Confirmation messages added for functions to **provide feedback** to user

# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

### Executive Summary

In phase III of our report, we focused on user testing with a functional prototype (limited by the XD software). We interviewed a **professor** and **four students** from the same class. The interviews were designed to **collect data about specific tasks** and to see if the participants could complete them in a manner that would be **similar to other software that has similar features** answering the fundamental question; Is the Usability Experience **familiar and learnable**?

We created our initial **prototypes** to:
* **Mimic** the functionality of the programmed **application**.
* Create a **workflow** we are going **to use in our application**.
* Emphasize the most **common tasks**.
* Prepare for **user testing**.

After receiving the feedback from our User Test, there were many common areas where we could improve. That includes our application and the tasks in our user test.
* Students found that the **members button could be an icon** instead of a dropdown.
* Students found that the **logout button is less important on mobile than web**.
* Students found that a **person icon would be better than a gear icon** denoting an account.
* Students found that completing tasks was familiar using **common conventions*.
* professor found that it would be useful to have an **archive feature for groups/teams** no longer being used.

The fact that none of the students got stuck on any tasks either indicates that the UI was well designed using common conventions or that the **tasks were too simple to test learnability**. Moving forward, these are the changes that we could make.
* Improve the tests by having the user **start at the beginning of the first task** for each new task. This can better test if the application is learnable.
* Make the tasks a **multi-step and multi-page process** to better understand users' paths as they navigate the application. Could give **insight to better/other workflows**.
* **Make recommended changes** based on the feedback from the user test.
* **Run another user test** with the everything listed above.
