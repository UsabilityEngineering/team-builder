Name: Margarita Ruiz
Employee at Hot Topic
22 year old female in Seattle, Washington
BS in Computer Science, senior student actively applying to jobs for graduation.
Background:
Rita, short for Margarita, struggles with school because her “part-time” job is taking more time
than it was supposed to. She likes to spend time with her boyfriend but he also works a lot and
doesn't find much time to spend together.
Her favorite classes are the ones that take the least amount of time to complete. As much as
she likes computer science classes, they take too long to complete assignments. She often
looks for programs that improve her workflow to save time.
Goals:
1. Save time in any way possible
2. Work on assignments with her friends
3. Work in groups where she doesn’t have to be the leader
